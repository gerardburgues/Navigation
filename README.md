# Navigation

In this project the goal is simple. Using a navigation map and with Start-coordinate and End-coordinate I found the best route between those two points.
To find it I used metro as a transport between Barcelona stations. So to conclude I found what is the optim number of stops we have to do.

To develop this program I used 4 methods:

  - Depth First Search
  - Breadth First Search
  - Unirofm Cost Search
  - A-star ( need to improve  but implemented).
  
 ##SearchAlgorithm.py has been the code I developed with all those methods implemented. SubwayMap.py has been the file that my university gave me with the classes implemented.
 
 ##This project has been tested with an excellent mark. For privacy reasons I haven't upload  the TestCases.py file.
